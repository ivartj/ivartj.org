Source for generating the static site content of [ivartj.org](http://ivartj.org/).
It previously used my [tpl](https://github.com/ivartj/tpl) template system, but
I migrated to using XQuery with BaseX as a more well-established, versatile and
standardized solution. I continue to use my [BBCode
processor](https://github.com/ivartj/bbcode) for generating HTML content.
